# ðŸš€ IBM Applied Data Science Capstone ðŸš€
This repository contains the final project for the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone. The goal of this project is to apply data science techniques learned throughout the course to solve a real-world problem.

### ðŸš€ Project background and context
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. The goal of the project is to predict if the first stage will land succesfully.

### ðŸš€ Questions to be answered
- What factors determine if the rocket will land succesfully? <br />
- The interaction amongst various features that determine the success rate of a successful landing. <br />
- What operating conditions needs to be in place to ensure a successful landing program? <br />
