# ðŸš€ IBM Applied Data Science Capstone ðŸš€

## Project Overview
This capstone project focuses on predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket landings to determine launch costs. By analyzing various factors influencing landing outcomes, the project provides insights that could help competitors bid against SpaceX more effectively.

## Project Goals
- Predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.
- Identify key factors influencing landing success.
- Analyze interactions between features to understand success rates.
- Determine optimal operating conditions for successful landings.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Used SpaceX REST API and web scraping from Wikipedia to gather launch data.
   - Cleaned and processed data to handle missing values and encode categorical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Conducted SQL queries to analyze launch sites, payloads, and mission outcomes.
   - Visualized relationships between flight numbers, payload mass, launch sites, and orbit types.

3. **Interactive Visual Analytics**  
   - Created maps with Folium to mark launch sites and success/failure outcomes.
   - Built an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash to explore payload ranges and success rates.

4. **Machine Learning Prediction**  
   - Applied classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN) to predict landing success.
   - Evaluated models using Jaccard Score, F1 Score, and Accuracy.

## Key Findings
- **Best Model**: Decision Tree achieved the highest accuracy (91.11%).
- **Payload Impact**: Lighter payloads correlated with higher success rates.
- **Launch Sites**: KSC LC-39A had the highest success rate among all sites.
- **Orbit Types**: ES-L1, GEO, HEO, and SSO orbits showed a 100% success rate.
- **Temporal Trend**: Success rates improved steadily over the years.
